# AWStest

Create a webapp which has two sections.

Section 1 : You can upload any valid pic(JPG/PNG), pdf or word doc only with limit 2MB.

Section 2 : Here you can see the listing of all your documents. (URL only)


Technology stack :
Spring MVC
Hibernate
MySQL : A table which consists all the generated S3 URLs
AWS S3 : All the documents will be uploaded on this server and there is a specific public URL of it.
Don't forget client and server side validation.
Don't focus too much on UI part, simple bootstrap would be enough. Focus on functionality.
